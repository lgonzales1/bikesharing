## Summary

The results of this analysis suggest that many bikesharing trips are used by men during their normal weekday communte, which is often less than 20 minutes. If this study will be applied to Des Moines, it is recommended that Citi-Bike investors have the following analysis:

* Additional analysis on specific commute patterns. This may provide additional information that may close the gender gap. For example, if women using Citi-Bike, only commute to downtown offices or if they commute in other areas, like to parks. 

* Analysis on Des Moines residents who own a car and are willing to partake in public transit or bikesharing. This will allow Citi-Bike investors to understand the demand and likely usage of Des Moines residents.
